# my_personal_projects


This is a collection of all my personal projects outside of school!

Hopefully this list grows bigger

1. [Personal Image Link Changer for Github](https://github.com/aleukh/my_personal_projects/blob/main/python/image-links-changer.py)

- As I use Obsidian to take my notes, changing the image links to the one that will be eventually used on Github is quite troublesome
- The script helps me to change all links to appropriate one, reducing time wastage
### TODO

- implement the script so that it may help other users too
- may check for directories with a .git file
